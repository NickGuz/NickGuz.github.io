This guide is still untested, but in theory should work on the steam deck or any
other linux distro. Maybe pictures coming soon.

** Base Game Installation

Download the Ubisoft Connect installer to your Downloads directory
#+begin_src shell
  curl -o $HOME/Downloads/UbisoftConnectInstaller.exe -L https://ubi.li/4vxt9
#+end_src

Now we want to add the installer to steam:
1. Click "Add a Game", then "Add a Non-Steam game" in the bottom left of your
   steam library.
2. Click "Browse" and find the installer we just downloaded. You will probably
   need to change the "Look in" directory at the top to something like
   /home/username in the dropdown. Also change file type to "All Files" so you
   can actually see the .exe file.
3. Open the file, then click "Add Selected Programs".
4. Find UbisoftConnectInstaller.exe in your library now, right click it and go
   to properties.
5. Click "Compatibility", check "Force the use of a specific Steam Play
   compatibility tool, then pick "Proton Experimental" from the dropdown.  Note:
   this may break in the future, but at the current moment proton experimental
   works well for this. If it doesn't work, try using an older version of
   proton.

Now you can just click "Play" and you should see the installer popup. Just run
through this like usual, but don't check the box at the end to start the
launcher just yet.

Once this is done, we want to change this library entry to open the launcher we
just installed instead of the installer.
1. Go back into the ubisoft launcher properties in steam.
2. Click "Browse" under "Target" and "Start In" and select "UbisoftConnect.exe"
   from the wine prefix we just created.  This should be the most recently
   updated prefix in ~/home/deck/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/compatdata~.  The
   full path will look something like
   #+begin_src shell
     /home/nickguz/.steam/steam/steamapps/compatdata/2965145486/pfx/drive_c/Program Files (x86)/Ubisoft/Ubisoft Game Launcher/UbisoftConnect.exe
   #+end_src
   
"Play" this again and it'll open the Ubisoft launcher. Sign in and download
Trackmania like usual.
** Openplanet Installation

1. Download the Openplanet installer from https://openplanet.dev/download. Leave
   it in your Downloads directory.
2. We want to run the installer with the same proton version and wine prefix
   that we just used.  Assuming that your most recently updated directory is the
   one we've been working with, you should be able to run these commands, maybe
   modifying the steam directory location:
   #+begin_src shell
     # Find the most recently modified prefix
     tm_pfx=$(ls -At $HOME/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/compatdata | head -1)

     # Set the Proton directory to use. If you didn't use experimental, you'll need to choose whichever version you did use
     proton_dir="$HOME/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/Proton - Experimental"

     # Now run the installer. You might need to change the Openplanet filename if a newer version has been released
     WINEPREFIX=$HOME/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/compatdata/$tm_pfx/pfx $proton_dir/files/bin/wine $HOME/Downloads/OpenplanetNext_1.25.21.exe
   #+end_src
3. If everything was set properly in the last step, you should be able to run
   through the installer like normal.  You should be able to find Trackmania in
   the C directory. It will be in ~C:\Program Files (x86)\ Ubisoft\ Ubisoft Game
   Launcher\Games\Trackmania~.  Select this directory. If you don't see that
   there, the wine prefix is most likely not set correctly. Make sure it's set
   to the pfx dir of the correct prefix.

Okay, we're almost done. Now we just need to enable the ~dinput8.dll~.

1. Install protontricks if you don't already have it. On steam deck, this can be
   done through Discover.
2. Open a terminal (can use Konsole on steam deck) and run this command to open
   winecfg on our prefix:
   #+begin_src shell 
    protontricks -c winecfg $(ls -At $HOME/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/compatdata | head -1)
   #+end_src
   I'm not sure if this works on steam deck yet, so if protontricks doesn't work
   from the command line just search protontricks in the KDE start menu ->
   select the proper steam app -> Select the default wineprefix -> Run winecfg
   to open the same menu.
3. Click the Libaries tab. In the "New override for library" box, enter
   ~dinput8~ and click Add, Apply, OK.

If all went well, the next time you boot up Trackmania you should see in the
topleft corner the little Openplanet notification. You probably want to edit
your controller layout if playing on steam deck and bind some button to F3 so
that you can actually open Openplanet.

And one last thing. If you want your Ubisoft Connect in steam to open Trackmania
directly, just add ~uplay://launch/5595/0~ to launch options. This will leave
the Ubisoft launcher open though after exiting, so just close that after closing
Trackmania, or just force close it through steam (B to abort on steam deck after
exiting Trackmania).

All done!
